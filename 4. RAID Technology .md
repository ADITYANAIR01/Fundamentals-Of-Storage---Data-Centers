                RAID Technology 

• RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks.

• It is a technology that enables greater levels of performance, reliability and/or 
large volumes when  dealing with data.

• High performance is achieved by concurrent use of two or more ‘hard disk drives’.

• Mirroring, Stripping (of data) and Error correction techniques combined with multiple disk arrays gives the desired reliability and performance.

Commonly used ones:
1. RAID 0
2. RAID 1
3. RAID 5
4. RAID 10
