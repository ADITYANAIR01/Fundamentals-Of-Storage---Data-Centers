            Magnetic Media (Hard disk drive)

- Magnetic storage is an example of a non-volatile memory, which means when the storage device is not powered,
then the data does not get lost and is retained.

- Magnetic storage use various patterns of magnetisation in magnetisable material to store the data.

- Magnetic storages are relatively cheap and are widely used for data storage.

 Examples of devices that use the magnetic media are tapes, disks, and diskettes.

                    Optical Media(CD DVD)
- Optical media are the kind of storage media that contain the content in a digital format and the 
read/write feature can be performed on them using a laser.

- The examples of optical media include 

CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, and all the variations of the two formats, as well as optical jukeboxes.
Optical media can last up to seven times as long as any traditional storage media.


                    Solid state media(SSD)
• It is made up of silicon microchips. It is a non-volatile storage and stores data electronically instead of 
storing it magnetically. 

• It contains no mechanical parts, which allows the transfer of data, to and from the storage medium, to 
take place at a very higher speed.

• Provides data integrity and endurance as any other electronic device.

• An example of a device that uses the solid state media is a removable flash memory.
