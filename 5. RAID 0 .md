                RAID 0 

• It splits data among two or more disks.

• Provides good performance.

• Lack of data redundancy means there is no fail over support with this configuration.

• In the diagram to the right, the odd blocks are written to disk 0 and the 
even blocks to disk 1 such that A1,A2, A3, A4, … would be the order of blocks if read 
sequentially from the beginning.

• Used in read only NFS systems and gaming systems.
