                RAID 1 
• RAID 1 is ‘data mirroring’.

• Two copies of the data are held on two physical disks, and the data is always identical.

• Twice as many disks are required to store the same data when compared to RAID 0.

• Array continues to operate so long as at least one drive is functioning.
