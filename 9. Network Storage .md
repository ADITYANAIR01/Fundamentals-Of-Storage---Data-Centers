                Storage Networking Technologies

There are 4 basic forms of Network Storage:

• Direct attached storage (DAS)

• Network attached storage (NAS)

• Storage area network (SAN)

• Internet Protocol Storage area network (IP-SAN)

                    NAS(Network Attached Storage )

• NAS is a dedicated storage device, and it operates in a client/server mode.

• NAS is connected to the file server via LAN.

• Protocol: NFS (or CIFS) over an IP Network

• Network File System (NFS) – UNIX/Linux

• Common Internet File System (CIFS) – Windows Remote file system (drives) 
mounted on the local system (drives) o evolved from Microsoft NetBIOS, 
NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT), and Server Message Block (SMB)

• Advantage: No distance limitation

• Disadvantage: Speed and Latency

• Weakness: Security

                    Storage area network (SAN)

• A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a specialized, dedicated high speed network joining servers and 
storage, including disks, disk arrays, tapes, etc.

• Storage (data store) is separated from the processors (and separated processing). 

• High capacity, high availability, high scalability, ease of configuration, ease of reconfiguration.

• Fibre Channel is the de facto SAN networking architecture, although other network standards could 
be used.

                    IP-SAN 

• IP storage networking – carrying storage traffic over IP

• Uses TCP, a reliable transport for delivery

• Can be used for local data center and long haul applications

Two primary IETF protocols/standards:

• iSCSI – Internet SCSI – allows block storage to be accessed over a TCP/IP network as though it 
were locally attached

• FCIP – Fibre-Channel-over-IP – used to tunnel Fibre Channel frames over TCP/IP connections
