                                What is DATA
Collection of raw data from which conclusions may ve drawn 
Information is Intelligence and knowledge derived from data.

                             What is a data center?
Data centers store and manage a large volume of mission-critical data. Organizations maintain data centers to provide integrated 
data processing facility across the system.


                What is Information Availiblity?
 In FSDC IA refers to abllity to acess & retrieve data whenever it is needed.


                    Redundancy

Redundancy is fundamental concept of achieving high availability, This includes having duplicate components such as 
storage devices, servers, power supplies & network connections. So if one fails another can take over seamlessly.
Redundancy help prevent single point of faliure.

                    Data Replication 

Data replication involves creating & maintaining copies of data in multiple locations, This can we within the data centers or
dispersed across the geographical data centers.

                    Backup & Restore

Backup & Restore of critical data are essential for IA in the event of data corruption, accidental deletion or catastropic Faliure.
Having up to date backup ensure that data can be restored to a previous state.

                    Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes workloads across multiple servers or storage devices to prevent overusage of a single component.
This not only ensures performance but also contributes to availiblity by  preventing resource bottlenecks.
